Nathan Hanak Coursework 3 Repo


This repository contains Nathan Hanak's attempt at Coursework 3 for the PiJ class
for the Birkbeck MSc Computer Science program.

The program "Contact Manager" contains a mock scheduling program intended for use by
a small business. It contains Meetings past and present as well as contacts who attend said meetings.
The program saves and stores all the information, also allowing notes to be stored and continuously added
to all meetings.

Program also contains a Flush feature which allows the program to save all information locally
to an external file. As long as that file stays intact without external influence, 
it will reload all previously stored information upon re-opening the program. The program will
also check to see if any Future meetings have "expired" or passed their deadlines and promptly 
convert them in to a past meeting.
